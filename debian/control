Description: libmaus2 is a collection of data structures and algorithms
 libmaus2 contains a collection of data structures and algorithms, many of
 which have applications in bio-informatics. In particular this includes
 .
  - I/O classes (single byte and UTF-8)
  - bitio classes (input, output and various forms of bit level manipulation)
  - text indexing classes (suffix and LCP array, fulltext and minute (FM), ...)
  - BAM sequence alignment files input/output (simple and collating)
 .
 and many lower level support classes.
